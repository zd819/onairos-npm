# Mobile Training Routes Summary & SDK Guidelines

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Strict Data Validation** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Users with 70 upvoted but 0 downvoted interactions were allowed to proceed with training, creating severely imbalanced models.

**Solution**: Enhanced `checkSufficientData()` function to:
- **STOP training** if user has 0 negative interactions (previously was just a warning)
- **STOP training** if user has 0 positive interactions  
- Require minimum 3+ positive AND 3+ negative interactions for training
- Provide clear error messages with specific guidance for each platform

**Impact**: Users will now get proper error messages telling them exactly what they need to do:
```json
{
  "error": "No negative interaction data found! You need to dislike/downvote content...",
  "code": "INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
  "details": {
    "upvotedCount": 70,
    "downvotedCount": 0,
    "missingNegativeData": true,
    "suggestions": [
      "‚ùå CRITICAL: You have no negative data - model cannot learn without both positive and negative examples",
      "üëé Dislike/downvote content on your connected platforms:",
      "‚Ä¢ YouTube: Dislike videos you don't enjoy",
      "‚Ä¢ Reddit: Downvote posts you disagree with"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. **Standardized Encryption + ARDrive Storage** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Encryption and permanent storage were only available in a separate "advanced" route, but should be standard for ALL models.

**Solution**: Made encryption and ARDrive storage **standard for all training routes**:

#### **Route 1: `/mobile-training/clean` (Regular SDK Users)**
- **Purpose**: Standard mobile training for regular SDK users
- **Features**: 
  - ‚ùå NO inference testing
  - ‚úÖ Model training only
  - ‚úÖ **AES-256-CBC encryption with user PIN + server key**
  - ‚úÖ **ARDrive (Arweave) permanent storage**
  - ‚úÖ **S3 fallback if ARDrive fails**
  - ‚úÖ **gzip compression**
  - ‚ùå No dual database storage
- **Use Case**: Regular mobile apps that need secure, permanent model storage

#### **Route 2: `/mobile-training/enoch` (Enoch SDK Users)**
- **Purpose**: Advanced training for Enoch SDK with inference and matching
- **Features**:
  - ‚úÖ WITH inference testing (72 test categories)
  - ‚úÖ Model training
  - ‚úÖ **AES-256-CBC encryption with user PIN + server key**
  - ‚úÖ **ARDrive (Arweave) permanent storage**
  - ‚úÖ **S3 fallback if ARDrive fails**
  - ‚úÖ **gzip compression**
  - ‚úÖ Stores in both main & Enoch databases
  - ‚úÖ Stores query scores for matching
- **Use Case**: Enoch SDK that needs inference results, matching, and secure storage

#### **~~Route 3: `/mobile-training/encrypted`~~ (REMOVED)**
- **Status**: ‚ùå **REMOVED** - Encryption is now standard for all routes
- **Migration**: Use `/mobile-training/clean` or `/mobile-training/enoch` instead

### 3. **ARDrive Error Fixed** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `ReferenceError: arDrive is not defined` error preventing ARDrive uploads.

**Solution**: Uncommented ARDrive imports in `src/utils/arweaveUtils.js`:
```javascript
import Arweave from 'arweave';
import { ArDrive } from 'ardrive-core-js';
```

## SDK Implementation Guidelines

### **Regular Mobile SDK (iOS/Android)**
**Use Route**: `/mobile-training/clean`

**Request Example**:
```javascript
POST /mobile-training/clean
Headers: {
  "Authorization": "Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
Body: {
  "socketId": "user_socket_id",
  "connectedPlatforms": {
    "platforms": [
      {
        "platform": "youtube",
        "accessToken": "token",
        "userData": {}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Clean mobile training started successfully",
  "username": "user_123",
  "features": {
    "inference": false,
    "storage": "ARDrive with S3 fallback",
    "compression": true,
    "encryption": true,
    "type": "clean-mobile-training"
  }
}
```

### **Enoch SDK**
**Use Route**: `/mobile-training/enoch`

**Request Example**: Same as above, but different endpoint

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Enoch mobile training started successfully",
  "username": "user_123",
  "features": {
    "inference": true,
    "storage": "ARDrive with S3 fallback",
    "compression": true,
    "encryption": true,
    "type": "enoch-mobile-training",
    "databases": ["main", "enoch"],
    "queryScores": true
  }
}
```

### **~~Advanced/Encrypted SDK~~ (REMOVED)**
**Status**: ‚ùå **REMOVED** - Encryption is now standard for all routes
**Migration**: Use `/mobile-training/clean` or `/mobile-training/enoch` based on your needs
**Requirements**: All routes now require user to have PIN set up for encryption

## Error Handling Updates

### **New Error Codes**

#### `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
- **When**: User has 0 positive OR 0 negative interactions
- **Action**: Show specific guidance for each platform
- **UI**: Display platform-specific instructions

#### `CONNECTIONS_REQUIRED`
- **When**: User has no connected social media accounts
- **Action**: Redirect to connection setup
- **UI**: Show available platforms to connect

#### `LIMITED_DATA`
- **When**: User has some data but less than recommended amounts
- **Action**: Warn user but allow training to continue
- **UI**: Show warning with suggestions for better results

#### `PIN_REQUIRED` (NEW)
- **When**: User doesn't have PIN set up (required for encryption)
- **Action**: Redirect to PIN setup flow
- **UI**: Show PIN setup instructions and requirements

### **Socket Events**

All training routes emit these events:

```javascript
// Progress updates
socket.on('trainingUpdate', (data) => {
  if (data.error) {
    // Handle error (stop training, show message)
    console.error('Training error:', data.error);
  } else if (data.warning) {
    // Handle warning (show warning, continue training)
    console.warn('Training warning:', data.warning);
  } else {
    // Handle status update
    console.log('Training status:', data.status);
  }
});

// Training completed
socket.on('trainingCompleted', (data) => {
  console.log('Training completed:', data.status);
});

// Model ready
socket.on('modelStandby', (data) => {
  console.log('Model ready:', data.message);
  // data.inference = true/false (indicates if inference was run)
  // data.storage = "ARDrive with S3 fallback" (indicates storage approach)
  // data.encryption = true (all models are now encrypted)
});
```

## Migration Guide

### **For Existing SDKs**

1. **Identify your SDK type**:
   - Regular mobile app ‚Üí Use `/mobile-training/clean`
   - Enoch SDK ‚Üí Use `/mobile-training/enoch`
   - ~~Advanced/encrypted~~ ‚Üí **REMOVED** (encryption is now standard)

2. **Update your endpoints**:
   - Replace `/mobile-training/encrypted` ‚Üí Use `/mobile-training/clean` or `/mobile-training/enoch`
   - Replace existing training endpoints with appropriate new route
   - Update error handling to support new error codes
   - **IMPORTANT**: All routes now require user PIN for encryption

3. **Test data validation**:
   - Ensure your app handles `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` errors properly
   - Test with users who have no negative data
   - Verify UI shows appropriate platform-specific guidance
   - **NEW**: Ensure your app handles encryption requirements (user PIN setup)

### **For New SDKs**

1. **Choose appropriate route** based on your needs
2. **Implement proper error handling** for all new error codes
3. **Test with various data scenarios**:
   - No connections
   - No negative data
   - No positive data
   - Limited data
   - Sufficient data

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test user with no connected accounts
- [ ] Test user with 0 negative interactions
- [ ] Test user with 0 positive interactions  
- [ ] Test user with limited data (< 10 interactions)
- [ ] Test user with sufficient data (> 10 interactions)
- [ ] **NEW**: Test user without PIN setup (should get `PIN_REQUIRED` error)
- [ ] **NEW**: Test user with PIN setup (encryption should work)
- [ ] **NEW**: Test ARDrive upload success and S3 fallback scenarios
- [ ] Test socket connection handling
- [ ] Test error message display
- [ ] Test training completion flow
- [ ] Verify correct route is being used for your SDK type
- [ ] **NEW**: Verify encryption metadata is stored in user database
